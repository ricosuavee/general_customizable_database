I've stripped down the script data_entry_script.py so that it simply opens a database, creates a cursor, and then commits any changes made and closes the connection. 

Current problems: 
1) I'm not sure if a .db file is actually being created, and if it is, it is not saving in the specified working directory

2) I'm not sure whether a connection should be open for the duration of the script's runtime. Is this a potential security issue? 

3) I'm not sure whether the same cursor should be used for all commands for the duration of the scripts run. It has the potential to streamline the code, so unless it's a security issue, I think it might be a good idea. 

Next steps: 

- Determine if 2 + 3 are issues 
- Get .db file to save in specified working directory
- Create a table in the database and save changes
