- look over rymac131 code 
- identify next step in code that does not rely on rymac131's project
-or, work on rymac131 sideproject until it is functional and incorporate it into the code
- i think that an important next step will be building out the functions that are wrappers for SQL, for verifying and editing entered data 
- another aspect that could be worked on is a package that imports and exports .xlsx and .csv files
